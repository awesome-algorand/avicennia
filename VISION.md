# Vision

Bridge traditional Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) with the Algorand Blockchain and Ecosystem.
Traditional PKI systems rely on a centralized Certificate Authority (CA) to issue and manage digital certificates.
This centralization creates a single point of failure and a potential security risk.
By leveraging the Algorand blockchain, we can create a decentralized PKI system that is more secure and reliable.

- Auditability: All certificate issuance and revocation events are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail.
- Decentralization: No single point of failure, no need to trust a central authority.
- Security: Certificates are validated on the blockchain, reducing the risk of tampering or forgery.(Possibly store the certificates on-chain)


## Reasoning:

This in theory should reduce the burden of trust on the CA (LetsEncrypt) and increase the security of the system.
